# Table CRUD with PrimeNG integration

This project is a simple integration between Angular, PrimeNG, and the CRUD API service provided by [crudcrud.com](https://crudcrud.com). It is intended for educational purposes only.

## Functionality

The Table CRUD with PrimeNG integration allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on a table of to-do items. The table displays the item's description and status, and users can edit or delete items directly from the table.

## API Key

To use this project, you will need an API key from [crudcrud.com](https://crudcrud.com). If you have exhausted the list of requests for your current key, you will need to obtain a new key. To do so, open a new incognito window in your browser and navigate to [crudcrud.com](https://crudcrud.com). Generate a new API key, and copy it to the `apiKey` variable in the `api/todo.service.ts` file.
